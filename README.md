# üöó Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) System

## Overview
This repository presents an advanced Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) system designed to detect and extract license plate information from vehicle images. Leveraging cutting-edge technologies such as **Ultralytics YOLOv8** for object detection and **EasyOCR** for optical character recognition, this system offers high accuracy and efficiency in real-world applications.

## üîß Features
- **High-Accuracy Detection**: Utilizes Ultralytics YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art object detection model, to accurately identify license plates in various conditions.
- **Robust OCR Integration**: Employs EasyOCR to extract textual information from detected license plates, supporting multiple languages.
- **Flexible Input Handling**: Capable of processing images from various sources, including local files, URLs, and video streams.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Optimized for real-time performance, suitable for applications like traffic monitoring and surveillance.
- **Easy Deployment**: Designed with user-friendly configuration and deployment in mind.

## üß† How It Works

The ANPR system operates through a multi-stage pipeline:

1. **Object Detection**: YOLOv8 detects potential license plate regions within input images.
2. **Preprocessing**: Detected regions are cropped and preprocessed to enhance OCR accuracy.
3. **Optical Character Recognition**: EasyOCR extracts textual information from the preprocessed regions.
4. **Postprocessing**: Extracted text is cleaned and formatted for output.

This approach ensures high accuracy and robustness, even under challenging conditions such as varying lighting and occlusions.
